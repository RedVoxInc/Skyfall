Skyfall: Signal Fusion from a Smartphone Falling from the Stratosphere
====================================================================================

**Skyfall** is a high-quality dataset that showcases the `RedVox SDK <https://github.com/RedVoxInc/redvox-python-sdk>`_
and the `RedPandas library <https://github.com/RedVoxInc/redpandas>`_ for processing smartphone data collected
with the `RedVox Infrasound Recorder app <https://www.redvoxsound.com/>`_.

**What is Skyfall?**

In essence, Skyfall is an event where a smartphone fell from a high altitude and landed on the ground. A balloon hoisted a commercial, off-the-shelf, smartphone to a height of 36 km (around 119,000 feet) and purposely burst
to let the smartphone freefall (hence the name *Skyfall*). As the smartphone fell back to Earth, it recorded its 30 minute
descent using the app.
